    <h3>Definition of Smart City</h3>
    <p>A Smart City is an urban area that leverages digital technologies, data analytics, and interconnected systems to
        improve the quality of life for residents, optimize city operations, and promote sustainable development. It
        integrates information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial
        intelligence (AI) to enhance urban infrastructure, including transportation networks, water and energy
        management, waste disposal, and public safety. Smart cities also provide more interactive and responsive
        governance, allowing citizens to report issues, access services digitally, and participate in urban planning,
        while making public spaces safer and more inclusive (European Commission, 2023; IBM, 2023).</p>

    improve the overall standard of living. Examples include Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, Barcelona’s smart
    lighting and waste management systems, and Jakarta’s “Jakarta Kini (JAKI)” platform, which enhances citizen
    engagement and public service delivery. Smart cities not only support sustainable urban growth but also
    encourage economic innovation, better resource management, and adaptive solutions for challenges such as traffic
    congestion, pollution, and an aging population (TechTarget, 2023; Plant Moran, 2018; Cisco, 2023).</p>
    <p>A Smart City is an urban area that utilizes digital technologies, data analytics, and interconnected systems to
        enhance the quality of life for its residents, improve operational efficiency, and promote sustainable
        development. It integrates information and communication technologies (ICT) into city management to optimize
        transportation, energy, water supply, and waste management while providing citizens with platforms to engage in
        governance and access public services efficiently (European Commission, 2023).</p>

    <p>In a smart city, IoT devices, sensors, and real-time data analytics are widely used to monitor and manage
        infrastructure. These technologies enable city administrators to make proactive decisions, reduce congestion,
        lower energy consumption, and improve overall urban livability. Residents experience safer, cleaner, and more
        convenient urban environments due to these intelligent systems (IBM, 2023).</p>
    <p>Smart cities also emphasize citizen engagement and economic innovation. Digital platforms allow residents to
        report issues, participate in urban planning, and interact with local authorities, while businesses benefit from
        better connectivity, logistics efficiency, and opportunities for technological development. The integration of
        AI, big data, and cloud computing enables cities to be adaptive, resilient, and responsive to emerging
        challenges (TechTarget, 2023).</p>
    <p>The benefits of smart cities extend to environmental sustainability and social welfare. By improving energy
        efficiency, monitoring pollution, and optimizing public services such as healthcare, transportation, and
        administrative processes, smart cities reduce their ecological footprint while enhancing citizens’ daily lives.
        Furthermore, they encourage public-private collaboration and attract innovative businesses, contributing to
        economic growth and technological advancement (Plant Moran, 2018).</p>
    <p>Ultimately, smart cities create a connected urban ecosystem where infrastructure, residents, and services
        interact intelligently. Advanced communication networks and integrated systems allow for real-time monitoring of
        traffic, utilities, and public safety, providing adaptive solutions to urban challenges. By fostering
        sustainable growth, efficiency, and inclusivity, smart cities aim to improve both the livability and resilience
        of urban environments (Cisco, 2023).</p>
